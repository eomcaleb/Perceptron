# Perceptron
## Single Layer Perceptron
This is an implementation of single layer perceptron that is capable of classifying data that is linearly separable.
This model is capable of solving AND, OR, NOR, NAND gates, but infamously known to fail on XOR gate. However, multi layer perceptron (MLP) is capable of distinguishing XOR gate and even more. 

This model is based on Neural Net- published by McCalloch and Pitt. It laied the foundation of what we know as machine learning/deep learning. Although the code is written in Python, it was initially meant to be a machine/hardware that is capable of reading images to discriminate one type of data to another.
