# Perceptron
## Single Layer Perceptron
This is an implementation of single layer perceptron that is capable of classifying data that is linearly separable.
This model is capable of solving AND, OR, NOR, NAND gates, but infamously known to fail on XOR gate. However, multi layer perceptron (MLP) is capable of distinguishing XOR gate and even more. 

The classic Perceptron model uses subgradient Stochastic Gradient Descent that utilizes Hinge loss function. However, different loss functions can be used to optimze the model even further.

This reposity is purely for representing Perceptron as close to how Frank Rosenblatt published initially. Comments or advices are welcomed any time.
